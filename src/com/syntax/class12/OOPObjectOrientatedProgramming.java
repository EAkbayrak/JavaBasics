		//OOP
		// Object oriented programming is just a way of writing code and classes and objects
		// are basic parts of this method
		
		/* Why we should learn the OOP?
		 *  1) because OOP simplifies the development of programs
		 *  2) it makes it easy to manage and maintain large programs
		 *  3) OOP is built around objects classes and many other things which can help us translate
		 *  real life objects into computers
		 *  
		 *  How to write programs using OOP?
		 *  
		 *  1) Create classes - inside the classes define properties/fields/attributes to translate how an 
		 *  	object from real life looks like
		 *  
		 * 	2) Create Methods/behaviours/functions to define how that thing works in real life
		 * 
		 * NOTE:
		 * 
		 * OOP is also supported in many other languages like C#, PHP, Python, Javascript
		 * other than OOP we also have different paradigm or ways of writing code functional 
		 * programming is one of it.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * How do we create a class and its object?
		 * 		class Human { Properties, attributes, fields)
		 * 			String name;
		 * 			int age;
		 * 			double;
		 * 
		 * 			(Method, Functions, behaviour )
		 * 
		 * 			void walk(){ 
		 * 			
		 * 			Main (String)
		 * 			
		 * 		
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 							
		 * }
		 * 
		 * 		
		 * }
